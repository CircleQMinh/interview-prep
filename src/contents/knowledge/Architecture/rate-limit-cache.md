## Rate Limiting Concepts

### What is rate limiting and why is it important?

Rate limiting is the process of controlling how many requests a client can make to an API or service within a specific time period.

It is important for:

- Preventing abuse and brute-force attacks
- Mitigating DoS (Denial of Service) attempts
- Protecting backend services from overload
- Ensuring fair usage across users
- Controlling infrastructure costs

---

### What are common rate limiting strategies?

#### Fixed Window

- Limits requests in a fixed time window  
- Example: 100 requests per minute  
- Simple but may allow bursts at window boundaries

#### Sliding Window

- Uses a moving time window  
- More accurate and fair than fixed window  
- Reduces boundary burst issue

#### Token Bucket

- Tokens are added at a fixed rate  
- Each request consumes a token  
- Allows short bursts while enforcing long-term limits

#### Leaky Bucket

- Requests are processed at a fixed rate  
- Excess requests are queued or dropped  
- Ensures smooth output rate

### Azure APIM Rate limiting

Azure APIM rate limiting is one of its most useful gateway features. It lets you throttle requests before they hit your backend, so you can protect services from spikes, abuse, and noisy clients. APIM provides built-in policies for both rate limits and quotas, and they behave a little differently.
A **rate limit** controls how many calls are allowed in a short rolling window, such as:

* 10 calls per second
* 100 calls per minute

When the limit is exceeded, APIM returns **`429 Too Many Requests`**. APIM supports:

* `rate-limit` for per-subscription limits
* `rate-limit-by-key` for per-key limits such as user, IP, tenant, or app ID.

### Quota

A **quota** controls total usage over a longer period, such as:

* 10,000 calls per day
* 1 GB per month
* lifetime call limits

When a quota is exceeded, APIM returns **`403 Forbidden`** and includes a `Retry-After` header. APIM supports:

* `quota` for per-subscription usage
* `quota-by-key` for per-key usage. 

A good mental model is:

```text
rate limit = spike protection
quota = usage allowance over time
```
### How do you implement rate limiting in ASP.NET Core?

Modern ASP.NET Core (7+) includes built-in rate limiting middleware.

Example:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.AddFixedWindowLimiter("fixed", opt =>
    {
        opt.PermitLimit = 100;
        opt.Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
        opt.QueueLimit = 0;
    });
});

app.UseRateLimiter();
````

Older versions may use third-party libraries such as `AspNetCoreRateLimit`.

---

### What is the difference between global and per-user rate limiting?

* **Global rate limiting**: Applies to all requests collectively (e.g., 10,000 requests per hour system-wide).
* **Per-user rate limiting**: Applies limits based on user identity (IP, API key, JWT claims).

Per-user limits are more common in public APIs.

---

### How do you handle burst traffic?

Use:

* Token bucket
* Sliding window
* Queueing mechanisms
* Short-term burst allowances with sustained rate enforcement

---

### How do you handle rate limiting in distributed systems?

In multi-instance environments, you need shared state:

* Redis (distributed cache)
* Central rate limiting service
* API Gateway-level rate limiting (e.g., Azure API Management)

This ensures consistent enforcement across instances.

---

### What is a backoff strategy?

A backoff strategy delays retries when rate limits are exceeded.

Common technique:

* **Exponential backoff**
* Wait time increases exponentially after each retry

Often combined with `Retry-After` HTTP headers.

---

### How do you differentiate limits for authenticated vs anonymous users?

* Anonymous users → stricter limits
* Authenticated users → higher limits
* Premium users → even higher quotas

This enables tiered API access models.

---

## Caching Concepts

### What is caching and why is it important?

Caching stores frequently accessed data in faster storage (usually memory) to reduce latency and backend load.

Benefits:

* Faster response time
* Reduced database load
* Lower infrastructure cost
* Improved scalability

---

### Types of caching in ASP.NET Core

1. **In-memory caching** (`IMemoryCache`)
2. **Distributed caching** (`IDistributedCache`)
3. **Response caching middleware**
4. **Output caching** (ASP.NET Core 7+)
5. **Data-level caching patterns**

---

### How do you implement in-memory caching?

```csharp
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMemoryCache _memoryCache;

    public MyController(IMemoryCache memoryCache)
    {
        _memoryCache = memoryCache;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        if (!_memoryCache.TryGetValue("myKey", out string cachedValue))
        {
            cachedValue = "Fresh Value";
            _memoryCache.Set("myKey", cachedValue,
                new MemoryCacheEntryOptions
                {
                    AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)
                });
        }

        return View(cachedValue);
    }
}
```

---

### How do you implement distributed caching?

```csharp
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IDistributedCache _distributedCache;

    public MyController(IDistributedCache distributedCache)
    {
        _distributedCache = distributedCache;
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
    {
        var cachedValue = await _distributedCache.GetStringAsync("myKey");

        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(cachedValue))
        {
            cachedValue = "Fresh Value";

            await _distributedCache.SetStringAsync(
                "myKey",
                cachedValue,
                new DistributedCacheEntryOptions
                {
                    AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)
                });
        }

        return View(cachedValue);
    }
}
```

### What is cache invalidation?

Cache invalidation removes or updates stale cached data.

Without proper invalidation, users may receive outdated data.

---

### Cache invalidation strategies

* Time-based expiration
* Manual invalidation
* Event-driven invalidation
* Versioned cache keys
* Write-through consistency patterns

---

### Cache expiration policies

Using `MemoryCacheEntryOptions` or `DistributedCacheEntryOptions`:

```csharp
_cache.Set("key", value, new MemoryCacheEntryOptions
{
    AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
    SlidingExpiration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)
});
```

Types:

* **Absolute expiration**
* **Sliding expiration**

---

### Cache Aside vs Read-Through

#### Cache Aside

* Application loads data
* Writes it into cache
* Most common in ASP.NET Core

#### Read-Through

* Cache layer loads data automatically
* Less common in .NET without specialized caching systems

---

### Write-Through vs Write-Behind

#### Write-Through

* Write to cache and database simultaneously
* Strong consistency

#### Write-Behind

* Write to cache first
* Persist to database asynchronously
* Higher performance but risk of data loss

---

### What is cache stampede and how do you prevent it?

Cache stampede occurs when many requests attempt to reload the same expired item simultaneously.

Prevention techniques:

* Locking (single flight)
* Distributed locks (e.g., Redis lock)
* Staggered expiration
* Early refresh
* Background refresh
* Lazy loading with synchronization

---

## Combining Rate Limiting and Caching

### How do they work together?

* Store rate limit counters in Redis
* Cache expensive responses
* Apply rate limiting before hitting backend services
* Use CDN for public endpoints

This combination improves:

* Performance
* Security
* Scalability

---

### What data should you cache?

Cache:

* Frequently accessed data
* Expensive database queries
* Third-party API responses
* Computed results

Avoid caching:

* Highly volatile data
* Sensitive per-request user data (unless scoped correctly)
* Large objects that rarely repeat

---

## Best Practices Summary

* Use built-in rate limiting in ASP.NET Core 7+
* Use distributed cache in multi-instance environments
* Keep cache TTL aligned with data volatility
* Prevent cache stampede
* Apply rate limiting at API Gateway level when possible
* Monitor hit ratio and eviction metrics


---

## Notes

- The original document stated that ASP.NET Core does not have built-in rate limiting. This is outdated. ASP.NET Core 7+ includes native rate limiting middleware.
- Clarified that Output Caching is officially supported starting from ASP.NET Core 7.
- Expanded distributed rate limiting discussion to include API Gateway options.
- Added additional cache stampede mitigation strategies for completeness.
